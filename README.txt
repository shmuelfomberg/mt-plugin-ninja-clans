Movable Type Plugin - Ninja Clans
=================================

Divide your users to clans, where each user can see only other users 
in his clan, and not other clans. 

Civilians (users that don't have a clan set) can not see any ninja.
Everyone can see Civilians. Administrator can see everybody. 

If a user sees something that user from other clan did, (i.e. an entry)
he will see "user deleted". because, ninjas.

This plugin have no purpose. it was just written for fun.

Installation
============

As any MT plugin, drop it into your plugins directory

Supports MT 5 and 6.

Settings
========

At System Overview->Tools->Plugins, go to this plugin settings and
list your clans. (comma-delimited list)

Now in every user profile page, there is a select box in the bottom 
where you can assign a user to a clan, or to "(none)" - a civilian.

Did I really wrote it?
